\section{Why deep architetures}

% notes from lecun's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOB4evKlEmQ

% Why deep learning instead of shallow learning since any deep architeture can
% be simulated by a shallow one?  According to yann le'cun it's because that is
% a trade-off between 'space' and computing time. It's true that shallow
% architetures can be simulated by a deeper one, but they run much much slower.

% Deep Supervised learning is hard beacuse the loss functions that are used in
% traing are non convex

% Backpropagation does not work well with networks that are tall and skinny
% lots of layers with few hidden units

% How to deal with limitations of linear classifiers You map the input to a
% higher dimension input where they are more easily separable

% How to build this: Use knowlege you already have to craft a feature set. We
% use a standard set of basis functions RBF Simplest approach use a kernel
% method
